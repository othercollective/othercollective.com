		<a name="tenets"></a> <div class="section">
			<h2 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Our tenets</h2>
			<p class="numbers">1</p>
			<p>We live in a dynamic world of increasing velocity, where new forms of communication are continuously changing how we relate to the world, how we relate to ourselves, and how we interact with others. But it is not merely accelerating around us: we are contributing just as much to these new contours of human experience. An enthusiastic curiosity about the potential for this new world is what excites us about our work.</p>
			<p class="numbers">2</p>
			<p>Design is the process of making decisions, whether conscious or arbitrary. We choose to leverage form, type, grid, color, space, and time with intention.</p>
			<p class="numbers">3</p>
			<p>Data is a means to an end and not the end itself. Data is not a number, it is the trace of a user. “Taste” for its own sake is suspicious: design decisions must be made in light of a data- and a research-driven understanding of the situation at hand.</p>
			<p class="numbers">4</p>
			<p>Discipline-based expertise remains a vital role, but a cross-functional approach has become crucial. A team must have the ability to collaborate across disciplines, to combine theoretical and practical knowledge, and to integrate diverse knowledge assets. To isolate knowledge is to risk losing its benefits.</p>
			<p class="numbers">5</p>
			<p>Everything has a context. A doorknob is designed for a door. A door is designed for a building. A building is designed for a city. Cities are built by and for our lives.</p>
			<p class="numbers">6</p>
			<p>Design is in our offices, our living rooms, and even our bedrooms. The best design is completely frictionless, and when implemented properly, recedes as a person accesses, learns, and does. It needs to be comfortable, ergonomic and most importantly, directed towards the users’ needs, regardless of medium, setting, or screen size.</p>
